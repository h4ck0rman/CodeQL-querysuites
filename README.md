# Background

Github Advanced Security implements Static code scanning through CodeQL queries and workflows. 

There are Default flows which are already configured once CodeQL is enabled. 

Advanced scanning involves using queries and suites. 

This directory should facilitate the learning and structuring of simple DevSecOps workflows for code scanning. The workflows that are to be included will expand across the board.
